# net
Strictly targeted (not portable) networking code for any of my future projects. WIP.  
current status is: TCP layer kind of finished, can create sockets sync and async ways, hook them up to an epoll event loop (or don't), remove the hook from epoll event loop, listen for errors, for incoming messages, for availability of outcoming messages (whether can send or nah), helper functions to switch nagle's algo on and off, to switch corking, can shut down socket, functions to clean up everything, sockets have their struct with details like ip family flags protocol bytes to be sent file descriptor and etc, sockets get auto cleaned up if a close event is detected (in (i think) every way, so through send(), through recv(), through connection shutdown (in any direction) events), and there is a sync & async getaddrinfo wrapper, with the async one you can also fetch multiple infos in one thread if u want (but can't with async connect & listen functions, with them you can only do 1 socket at a time), there are also wrappers for if you need to getaddrinfo before listening or connecting (it does it in 1 function so i guess kinda easier and nicer) and yeah  
oh and also no support for out of band messages bc they are basically unused  
to use `build` to build this, pls first do `chmod 755 build` so that it's set to executable, else it will prompt you an error.

No license. You don't have right to use the code, even though there is a license at the top of some of the files (this has priority).
